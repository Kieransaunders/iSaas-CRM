# Example Prompts for iSaaSIT

Use these prompts as starting points for AI-assisted development.

---

## Using GSD (Get Shit Done)

GSD is a meta-prompting system for spec-driven development. It structures AI-assisted coding into research → plan → execute → verify cycles.

### Quick Start with GSD

```
I'm working on the iSaaSIT project. Please use GSD methodology.

First, map the codebase to understand the current structure, then help me plan and implement [feature].

Start with: /gsd:map-codebase
```

### GSD New Project / Feature

```
I want to implement [feature] for iSaaSIT using GSD methodology.

Context:
- iSaaSIT is a multi-tenant SaaS for agencies
- Tech stack: TanStack Start + Convex + WorkOS AuthKit
- Current status: [describe current state]

Please use GSD workflow:
1. /gsd:new-project (if new) or /gsd:map-codebase (if existing)
2. /gsd:discuss-phase 1
3. /gsd:plan-phase 1
4. /gsd:execute-phase 1
5. /gsd:verify-phase 1

Requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

Follow iSaaSIT patterns from:
- .cursor/rules/02-convex-patterns.mdc
- .cursor/rules/05-multi-tenancy.mdc
```

### GSD Phase Execution

```
Let's proceed with /gsd:[action]-phase [phase-number] for [feature].

Reference the phase context in .planning/[phase]-CONTEXT.md
and the requirements in .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md.

Follow iSaaSIT coding patterns and ensure:
- Proper TypeScript types
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Convex best practices
```

## Standard Prompts (Without GSD)

### Initial Setup / PRD Prompt

```
I want to build a [type of SaaS] using iSaaSIT, an open-source SaaS starter kit.

Current stack:

- Tailwind CSS v4 (styling)

What exists:
- User authentication via WorkOS
- Protected routes
- Convex backend with JWT validation

What I need:
[Describe your feature requirements here]

Please:

## Tips for Best Results

### With GSD
1. **Start with map-codebase** - Let GSD understand your codebase first
2. **Use discuss-phase** - Clarify requirements before planning
3. **Trust the workflow** - Don't skip phases; each has a purpose
4. **Review plans before executing** - Plans are prompts, review them
5. **Verify after executing** - Check that goals were met

### Without GSD
1. **Be specific** - Include exact file paths, function names, requirements
2. **Reference rules** - Point to relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
3. **Provide context** - Explain what currently exists and what you need
4. **Include errors** - Paste full error messages for debugging
5. **Show examples** - Include relevant code snippets from your project

## Before Asking for Help

1. Check if a similar pattern exists in the codebase
2. Review relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files
3. Check `AGENTS.md` for project context
4. Try the development commands in `.cursor/rules/08-development-workflow.mdc`
5. **With GSD**: Run `/gsd:checkpoint` to review state
