title: Organizations
description: Your agency and the foundation of your client portal
---

Your Organization represents **your agency**—the foundation of your client portal platform.

## Overview

Each Organization:
- Represents your agency or company
- Is the owner of your client portal platform
- Manages your team (Admin and Staff roles)
- Contains your Customers (the clients who use your portal)
- Handles billing and subscriptions for your portal service

## Creating an Organization

Organizations are created via WorkOS. When a new user signs up:

1. WorkOS creates a User record
2. An Organization can be created or joined
3. Convex stores additional org data (subscription, limits)

## Organization Data Model

```typescript
// In Convex schema
organizations: defineTable({
  workosOrgId: v.string(),      // Link to WorkOS org
  name: v.string(),
  planId: v.optional(v.string()),
  subscriptionStatus: v.string(),
  maxCustomers: v.number(),
  maxStaff: v.number(),
  maxClients: v.number(),
})
```

## Roles within an Organization

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access, billing management, user invites |
| **Staff** | Access to assigned customers only |

## API Examples

### Get Current Organization

```typescript
// Convex query
export const getCurrent = query({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const user = await getCurrentUser(ctx);
    if (!user) return null;
    
    return await ctx.db
      .query('organizations')
      .withIndex('by_workos_org_id', q => 
        q.eq('workosOrgId', user.orgId)
      )
      .unique();
  },
});
```

## Usage Caps

Organizations have usage caps based on their subscription plan:

- `maxCustomers` - Maximum client companies
- `maxStaff` - Maximum staff members
- `maxClients` - Maximum client users per customer

These caps are enforced at the API level.
