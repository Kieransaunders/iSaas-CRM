# Deploying iSaaSIT to Production

**Published:** February 1, 2026

Ready to deploy your iSaaSIT application? This guide covers everything you need.

## Deployment Overview

iSaaSIT consists of three parts:

1. **Frontend** - TanStack Start app
2. **Backend** - Convex serverless functions
3. **Database** - Convex real-time database

## Deploying Convex

### 1. Deploy Your Backend

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This deploys your schema and functions to Convex's cloud.

### 2. Set Production Environment Variables

In the Convex dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add your production WorkOS credentials:
   - `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`
   - `WORKOS_API_KEY`

### 3. Configure Auth in Production

Update `convex.json` with your production AuthKit settings.

## Deploying the Frontend

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables in Netlify dashboard

### Option 2: Vercel

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_xxx
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_live_xxx
WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=your-production-secret
WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourdomain.com/callback
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Use production WorkOS credentials (sk_live_*)
- [ ] Use HTTPS redirect URIs
- [ ] Set strong cookie password
- [ ] Deploy Convex backend
- [ ] Configure CORS if needed
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test database operations

## Post-Deployment

### Verify Authentication

1. Sign up as a new user
2. Verify email confirmation
3. Test protected routes
4. Test sign-out

### Monitor Your App

- Check Convex dashboard for errors
- Monitor WorkOS authentication logs
- Set up application monitoring (Sentry, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid redirect_uri" Error

Ensure your production domain is added to WorkOS redirect URIs.

### Convex Connection Issues

Verify `VITE_CONVEX_URL` points to your production deployment.

### Auth Not Working

Check that you're using production WorkOS keys (sk_live_*, not sk_test_*).

## Conclusion

Deploying iSaaSIT is straightforward with Convex handling the backend and any static host for the frontend. Follow this checklist to ensure a smooth launch!
