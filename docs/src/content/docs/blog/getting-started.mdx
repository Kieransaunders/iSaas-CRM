Welcome to iSaaSIT! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to build and deploy your first **CRM SaaS**.

## What is iSaaSIT?

It provides:

- **CRM foundation** - Ready-to-deploy customer relationship management
- **Contact management** - Store and organize leads and customers
- **Deal pipelines** - Visual pipeline with drag-and-drop stages
- **Task management** - Track activities and follow-ups

## Understanding the Architecture

iSaaSIT uses a hierarchical data model:

3. **Users** - People who access the system

### CRM Features

The starter kit includes:

- **Contacts** - Individual people associated with customers
