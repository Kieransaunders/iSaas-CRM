Welcome to iSaaSIT! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to build and deploy your first **client portal**.

## What is iSaaSIT?

iSaaSIT is a **SaaS starter pack for agencies** who want to build **client portals**—secure, branded platforms where your customers can log in, access their project data, and collaborate with your team.

It provides:

- **Client portal foundation** - Ready-to-deploy portal for your customers
- **Multi-tenant architecture** - Each client sees only their own data
- **Built-in authentication** - Enterprise-grade auth with WorkOS AuthKit
- **Role-based access control** - Admin (you), Staff (your team), and Client (your customers)
- **Real-time database** - Convex powers your backend with live queries

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 20 or later
- A WorkOS account (free tier available)
- A Convex account (free tier available)

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd iSaaSIT
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your WorkOS and Convex credentials.

### 4. Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Understanding the Architecture

iSaaSIT uses a hierarchical data model:

1. **Organization** - Your agency
2. **Customers** - Your clients
3. **Users** - People who access the system

Each level has proper data isolation, ensuring clients only see their own data.
