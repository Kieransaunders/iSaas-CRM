# Multi-Tenant Architecture for CRM SaaS

**Published:** February 3, 2026

Multi-tenancy is the foundation that makes CRM applications possible. This post explains how it works in iSaaSIT and why it's perfect for agencies building CRMs for their clients.

## What is Multi-Tenancy?

Multi-tenancy is an architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple customers (tenants). Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.

```

## Benefits of Multi-Tenancy

### 1. Cost Efficiency

- Single codebase to maintain
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Easier updates and deployments

### 2. Data Isolation

- Each tenant's data is completely separate
- Security compliance is easier to manage
- Tenant-specific customizations are possible

### 3. Scalability

- Add new tenants without code changes
- Scale infrastructure based on overall demand
- No per-tenant deployment needed

## How iSaaSIT Implements Multi-Tenancy

### Organization Level

The top-level tenant in iSaaSIT is the Organization (agency). Each organization:

- Has its own subscription and billing
- Manages its own users and customer CRMs
- Cannot access other organizations' data

### Customer Level

Within an organization, Customers provide another layer:

- Each customer is a client company with their own CRM data
- Contacts, deals, and tasks are scoped to customers
- Staff can be assigned to specific customers
- Clients only see their own customer data

### Implementation in Code

```typescript
// Every query filters by organization
export const listCustomers = query({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const org = await getCurrentOrg(ctx);

    return await ctx.db
      .query('customers')
      .withIndex('by_org', (q) => q.eq('orgId', org._id))
      .collect();
  },
});
```

## CRM-Specific Considerations

When building a CRM, multi-tenancy becomes especially important because:

1. **Contact data is sensitive** - Personal information must be strictly isolated
2. **Deal values are confidential** - Revenue data varies by customer
3. **Pipeline visibility matters** - Sales processes differ per client
4. **Task assignments** - Staff access must be properly scoped

## Best Practices

1. **Always filter by tenant** in database queries
2. **Validate permissions** at the API level
3. **Use indexes** for efficient tenant-based queries
4. **Never expose tenant IDs** in URLs if possible
5. **Scope CRM queries** by customerId for deals, contacts, and tasks

## Conclusion

Multi-tenancy is essential for SaaS applications serving multiple clients. iSaaSIT provides a solid foundation with proper data isolation at every level, specifically designed for building CRM applications.
